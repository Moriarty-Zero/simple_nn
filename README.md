# ChatAI: A Neural Network-Based Chat Application

ChatAI is a Python-based chatbot application built with a Seq2Seq neural network model using PyTorch. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) powered by Tkinter, enabling users to interact with the chatbot in real-time.

---

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: An intuitive chat window for user interaction.
- **Custom Seq2Seq Model**: Implements an encoder-decoder architecture for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Dataset Management**: Handles preprocessing, tokenization, and vocabulary building from a dataset.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Includes training, validation, and testing pipelines with loss tracking.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides conversational responses using the trained model.
- **Persistence**: Saves the trained model for reuse without retraining.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **PyTorch**: For building and training the neural network.
- **Tkinter**: For GUI development (comes pre-installed with Python).
- **NLTK**: For tokenization.
- **pandas**: For data handling.
- **scikit-learn**: For dataset splitting.

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install torch nltk pandas scikit-learn
```

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Ensure the dataset file (`dataset/dataset1.csv`) is in place.

3. Train the model (if needed):
   ```bash
   python modelnn.py
   ```
   This will save the model weights to `model/prototype003.pth`.

4. Launch the chatbot interface:
   ```bash
   python window.py
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Run `window.py` to open the chatbot window.
2. Enter your question in the input field and press **Get Answer**.
3. View the response from the chatbot below the input field.
4. To exit, type "exit" or "quit" in the input field.

## Model Overview
The chatbot uses a Seq2Seq (sequence-to-sequence) model with the following components:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Encoder**: Processes input sequences using an LSTM network.
- **Decoder**: Generates output sequences using another LSTM network.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Maps the decoder's outputs to vocabulary indices.

The model is trained to predict answers based on input questions, leveraging tokenized text data from the dataset.

---

## Example Dataset Format
The dataset (`dataset/dataset1.csv`) should have the following structure:
| tokenize_question | tokenize_answer |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| hello             | hi             |
| how are you?      | i am fine      |

---

## Future Improvements
- **Expand Dataset**: Improve response quality with a larger and more diverse dataset.
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Implement techniques like stemming or lemmatization for better text understanding.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Experiment with hyperparameters and model architecture.
- **Deploy on the Web**: Integrate with web frameworks like Django or Flask for a broader audience.
